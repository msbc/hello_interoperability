# Hello Interoperability

Welcome to **Hello Interoperability**, a project that explores how to achieve interoperability between Python and other programming languages. The focus of this project is demonstrating how to call `print` statements in various languages from Python.

## Over Ambitious Goals

Text with ~~strikethrough~~ is used to indicate features that are/were planned but not yet implemented.

## Overview

Interoperability is a key aspect of modern software development, enabling developers to leverage the strengths of multiple programming languages within a single project. This repository provides examples and explanations for calling print statements in languages such as:

- C++
- ~~Fortran~~
- ~~Rust~~

## Features

- Examples of calling print statements in different languages.
- Step-by-step instructions for setting up and running the examples.
- ~~Insights into tools and libraries that facilitate interoperability (e.g., FFI, `ctypes`, `cffi`, etc.).~~

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/msbc/hello_interoperability.git
  cd hello_interoperability
  ```

2. Follow the instructions in each language-specific folder to set up and run the examples.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- Language-specific compilers or tools (e.g., GCC for C++, GFortran for Fortran, Rust toolchain).

## Examples

- **C++**: Using `pybind11` to call C++ functions from Python.
- ~~**Fortran**: Using `f2py` to integrate Fortran code with Python.~~
- ~~**Rust**: Leveraging `pyo3` to call Rust functions from Python.~~

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Feel free to submit issues or pull requests to improve the examples or add support for additional languages.
